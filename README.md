# pygame-snake

A python snake game that I made for educational purposes

to run you have to create new virtual environment and pip install -r requirements.txt, then just run main.py :)

The project has some bugs, however its fully playable. You can also clone my other project [snake-game-ai-pytorch](https://github.com/papadi166/snake-game-ai-pytorch) to see if you can beat artifical inteligence snake :)
